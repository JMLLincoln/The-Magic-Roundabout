Take a sequence of random integers (about 100)
iterate through the sequence 
do the following based on the value of each integer:

1: pop it
2: append to a second list
3: insert another 3 three spaces before (looping around if at the beginning)
4: carry out the function for the integer at position: [current index position / 4]
5: reverse the elements 5 spaces around this position e.g. AA5BB becomes BB5AA
6: add one on to a counter
7: do noting
8: remove counter number of items from the beginning of the list
9: get the count of 3s, divide that by 3 and turn that many into 9s


Always round down
