Taking an unordered League of Legends scoreboard (one side), replacing champion names with positions, EG:

SUPPORT
JUNGLE
MID
TOP
ADC

Get to the following order:

TOP
JUNGLE
MID
ADC
SUPPORT

In the least amount of moves. Moving X position to Y's spot will move Y to X's previous spot. Write a program that takes any arrangement of League of Legends positions and works out the fastest way to sort them.
