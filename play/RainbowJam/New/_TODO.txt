Make a .txt file with 5 times from 11am - 2pm and a single program/application next to the time, E.G.

11:15 Chrome
12:10 League of Legends
12:15 Notepad
12:30 Github Client
13:00 Spotify

The times must not have the same increment between them.

The program will be executed before the first time and should open each application at the time specified.
